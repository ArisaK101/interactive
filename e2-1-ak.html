    <p>Web design has come a long way since the days of dial-up internet.
    From the text-only interfaces of the 80s and blocky layouts of the 90s
    to the flashy
    <strong>‘web logs’</strong>
     (aka blogs) of the early
     <em> ‘00s,</em>
      we’ve seen many
    iterations of websites over the last 30 years. While it can be humorous
    to look back at these older websites and wonder ‘what were they thinking?’
    there’s plenty we can learn from looking back at the history of web design.
    By taking inspiration from the retro websites of yore,
    everything old can be new again.

    <sub>The late 80s — the dark ages of design</sub>
    <h1>The concept of the ‘world wide web’ is believed to date back
      as far as 1946, when it was first described in a short story by
       Murray Leinster. However, its official (albeit accidental)
      invention is credited to physicist Tim Berner-Lee in 1989. While creating
       a database of software for a client, he used hypertext to create an index of pages on the system.
      This eventually evolved into what we now know as web pages.</h1>
    <h2>This era of web design was known as the dark ages, as designers would work on black screens with pixels.
      Designs were made up of symbols and tabulation (also known as the TAB key) as you can see in this mock-up
      of what Google would have looked like in the 80s.</h2>
    <h3>While we may now see this iteration of web design as primitive,
      many designers still take inspiration from the post-modern
      aesthetic of the 80s. In a sea of ultra-modern websites, this web
      design layout stands out with its pixelated background, icons and blocky text.
    </h3>
    <sup>1991 — The first web page</sup>
    <h4>It’s not hard to see why Berners-Lee is thought of as the forefather
       of web design–the man was busy! On August 6, 1991, he launched the world’s
       first web page with the help of his team. Hosted on a NeXT computer at the
       European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, this was a simple page
       containing information about
      the World Wide Web.</h4>
    <h5>This breakthrough forged a path for web designers, who mainly
      worked with HTML tables to organize content horizontally and
      vertically. These were text-only pages, devoid of any of the visual elements we associate
      with modern web pages.</h5>
