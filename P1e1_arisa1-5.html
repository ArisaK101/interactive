  Seven months ago, I sat down at&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the small table <br>
  in the kitchen of my 1960s &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp& apartment, nestled on the <br>
  top floor of a building &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp in a vibrant central <br>
  neighbourhood of Tehran, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and I did   something I <br>
  had done thousands of &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp times previously. I opened my <br>
  laptop and posted to &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp my new blog. This, though, was <br>
  the first time in six &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp years. And it nearly <br>
  broke my heart. A few &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp weeks earlier, I’d been abruptly <br>
  pardoned and freed from &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Evin prison in northern Tehran. <br>
  I had been expecting to &nbsp&nbsp&nbspspend most of my life in those cells: <br>
  In November 2008, I’d been &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp sentenced to nearly 20 years <br>
   in jail, mostly for things &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I’d written on my blog. <br>
  But the moment, when it came, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp was unexpected. I smoked <br>
  a cigarette in the kitchen&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp with one of my fellow inmates, <br>
  and came back to the room &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I shared with a dozen other men. <br>
  We were sharing a cup of &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp tea when the voice of the floor <br>
  announcer — another prisoner &nbsp— filled all the rooms and corridors. <br>
  In his flat voice, he &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp announced in Persian: <br>
  “Dear fellow inmates,&nbsp&nbsp the bird of luck has once again sat on one <br>
  fellow inmate’s shoulders.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Mr. Hossein Derakhshan, <br>
  as of this moment, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp you are free.” <br>
  That evening was the first time that &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I went out of those <br>
  doors as a free man. Everything &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp felt new: The chill autumn <br>
  breeze, the traffic noise from &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a nearby bridge, the smell, <br>
  the colors of the city I had lived &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp in for most of my life. <br>
  Around me, I noticed a very different&nbsp&nbsp Tehran from the one I’d <br>
  been used to. An influx of new, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp shamelessly luxurious <br>
  condos had replaced the charming &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp little houses I was familiar <br>
  with. New roads, new highways, hordes &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp of invasive SUVs. <br>
  Large billboards with advertisements &nbsp&nbsp for Swiss-made watches and <br>
  Korean flat screen TVs. Women in &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp colorful scarves <br>
  and manteaus, men with dyed hair &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and beards, and hundreds of <br>
  charming cafes with hip western &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp music and female staff.<br>
  They were the kinds of changes &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp that creep up on people; the <br>
  kind you only really notice once&nbsp normal life gets taken away from you. <br>
  Two weeks later, I began writing &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp again. Some friends agreed <br>
  to let me start a blog as part&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp of their arts magazine. <br>
  I called it Ketabkhan — it means &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp book-reader in Persian. <br>
  Six years was a long time &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to be in jail, but it’s an entire <br>
  era online. Writing on the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp internet itself had not changed, <br>
  but reading — or, at least,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp getting things read — had altered <br>
  dramatically. I’d been told &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp how essential social networks <br>
  had become while I’d been &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp gone, and so I knew one thing: If <br>
  I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now. <br>
  So I tried to post a link &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to one of my stories on Facebook. <br>
  Turns out Facebook didn’t &nbsp&nbspcare much. It ended up looking like <br>
  a boring classified ad. No &nbsp&nbsp&nbspde scription. No image. Nothing. <br>
  It got three likes. Three!&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp That was it.<br>
  It became clear to me,&nbsp&nbsp right there, that things had changed. I <br>
   was not equipped to play&nbsp&nbsp on this new turf — all my investment <br>
  and effort had burned up.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I was devastated.<br>
