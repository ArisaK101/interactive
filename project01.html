      note: I have a suspicion that whoever invented virtual currency（bitcoin） is going to make money.
In my opinion, the period of time for which a currency can be used as a currency is very short unless it is backed by an institution whose credibility is unshakable, such as a country. When a country is built, it needs land, people, and government. Currency also requires people and institutions to use it, a system to punish wrongdoers, and a structure to prevent fraud in order for it to function as currency. There are also questions about how prices can plummet and make life difficult. If it makes people's lives better, virtual currency is of course welcome, but it seems not.
A world that is too obsessed with currency will suffer, while a world that is not obsessed with money will not have much currency in circulation.Some countries have used bitcoin as legal tender, but has it been successful? If they have failed, why and what process did they go through?
They usually take commission from users.
