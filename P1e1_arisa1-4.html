    Seven <br>
    months ago, <br>
    I sat down at the <br>
    small table in the kitchen <br>
    of my 1960s apartment, nestled on <br>
    the top floor of a building in a vibrant <br>
    central neighbourhood of Tehran, and I did something <br>
    I had done thousands of times previously. I opened my laptop <br>
    and posted to my new blog. This, though, was the first time in six years. <br>
    And it nearly broke my heart.  A few weeks earlier, I’d been abruptly pardoned and freed <br>
    from Evin prison in northern Tehran. I had been expecting  to spend most of my life in those cells:<br>
     In November 2008, I’d been sentenced to nearly 20 years in &nbsp j &nbsp a &nbsp i &nbsp l &nbsp, mostly  for things I’d written on my blog. <br>
     But the moment, when it came, was unexpected. I smoked a cigarette in the kitchen with one of my fellow inmates, and came <br>
     back to the room I shared with a dozen other men. We were sharing a cup of tea when the voice of the floor  announcer — another prisoner — <br>
    filled all the rooms and corridors. In his flat voice, he announced in Persian: “Dear fellow inmates, the bird of luck has once again sat on one fellow <br>
      inmate’s shoulders. Mr. Hossein Derakhshan,  as of this moment, you are free.” That evening was the first time that I went out of those doors as a free man. Everything <br>
      felt new: The chill autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a nearby bridge, the smell, the colors of the city I had lived in for most of my life.  Around me, I noticed a <br>
      very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to. An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar <br>
      with. New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs. Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat <br>
      screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves  and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with <br>
      hip western music and female staff.They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only <br>
      really notice once normal life gets taken away from you. Two weeks later, I began writing again. Some <br>
    friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it Ketabkhan <br>
    — it means book-reader in Persian. Six years was a long time to be in jail,base <br>
     but it’s an entire era online. Writing on the internet itself had notbr <br>
      changed, but reading — or, at least, getting things read — <br>
      had altered dramatically. I’d been told how <br>
      essential social networks <br>
  had become while I’d been <br>
  gone, and so I knew <br>
  one thing: If <br>
  I wanted <br>
   to lure people to <br>
   see my writing, I had to use <br>
   social media now. So I tried to post a link <br>
   to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn’t <br>
   care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. No description. <br>
   No image. Nothing. It got three likes. Three! That was it.  It became clear to me, <br>
   ight there, that things had changed. I was not equipped to play on this new turf — all my investment <br>
  and &nbsp &nbsp effort &nbsp&nbsp  had &nbsp&nbsp burned &nbsp&nbsp up&nbsp&nbsp. &nbsp&nbspI &nbsp&nbsp was &nbsp&nbsp devastated.
