     <em>   Web design has come a long way since <br>
        the days of dial-up internet.<br>
       From the text-only interfaces of the 80s and <br>
       blocky layouts of the 90s to the flashy ‘web logs’ <br>
        (aka blogs) of the early

    over the last 30 years. While it can be humorous to <br>
    look back at these older websites and wonder ‘what were <br>
    they thinking?’ there’s plenty we can learn from looking <br>
    back at the history of web design. By taking inspiration <br>
    from the retro websites of yore, everything old can be new again.

    <p>The late 80s — the dark ages of design</p><br>
  </em>
    <strong>The concept of the </strong><br>
    <h1>‘world wide web’</h1>
  <em>
      <strong> is believed to date back <br>
      as far as 1946, when it was first described in a short story by <br>
       Murray Leinster. However, its official (albeit accidental) <br>
      invention is credited to physicist Tim Berner-Lee in 1989. <br>
      While creating a database of software for a client, he used hypertext <br>
       to create an index of pages on the system. <br>
      This eventually evolved into what we now know as web pages.</strong> <br>
    <h2>This era of web design was known as the dark ages, as designers <br>
      would work on black screens with pixels. Designs were made up of <br>
      symbols and tabulation (also known as the TAB key) as you can see <br>
      in this mock-up of what Google would have looked like in the 80s.</h2>
    <h3>While we may now see this iteration of web design as primitive, <br>
      many designers still take inspiration from the post-modern <br>
      aesthetic of the 80s. In a sea of ultra-modern websites, this web <br>
      design layout stands out with its pixelated background, icons and blocky text. <br>
    </h3>
    <u>1991 — The first web page</u> <br>
    <h4>It’s not hard to see why Berners-Lee is thought of as the forefather <br>
       of web design–the man was busy! On August 6, 1991, he launched the world’s <br>
       first web page with the help of his team. Hosted on a NeXT computer at the <br>
       European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, this was a simple page <br>
       containing information about <br>
      the World Wide Web.</h4>
    <h5>This breakthrough forged a path for web designers, who mainly <br>
      worked with HTML tables to organize content horizontally and <br>
      vertically. These were text-only pages, devoid of any of the visual elements we associate <br>
      with modern web pages.</h5>
    <h6>1992 — The first photo on the internet</h6>
<sup>Long before celebrities ‘broke the internet’ or viral memes, a <br>
   seemingly mundane image started it all. In 1992, pop parody group <br>
    Les Horribles Cernettes became the subjects of the very first photo <br>
     on the internet. When Berners-Lee rolled out an update of his browser <br>
      that could support photos, his team tested it out of this image taken <br>
      of the band backstage by an IT developer.
