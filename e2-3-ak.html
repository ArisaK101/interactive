    ‘00s, we’ve seen many iterations of websites <br>
    over the last 30 years. While it can be humorous to <br>

    they thinking?’ there’s plenty we can learn from looking <br>
    back at the history of web design. By taking inspiration <br>

    <strong>
    from the retro websites of yore, everything old can be new again.
    The late 80s — the dark ages of design<br>
    The concept of the<br>
    ‘world wide web’ is believed to date back <br>
    as far as 1946, when it was first described in a short story by <br>
    Murray Leinster. However, its official (albeit accidental) <br>
    invention is credited to physicist Tim Berner-Lee in 1989. <br>
    While creating a database of software for a client, he used hypertext <br>
    to create an index of pages on the system. <br>
    This eventually evolved into what we now know as web pages. <br>
    This era of web design was known as the dark ages, as designers <br>
    would work on black screens with pixels. Designs were made up of <br>
    </strong>
      <h1>
      symbols and tabulation (also known as the TAB key) as you can see <br>
      in this mock-up of what Google <br>
      would have looked like in the 80s. <br>
      While we may now see this iteration of web design as primitive, <br>
      many designers still take inspiration from the post-modern <br>

      <h2>
      aesthetic of the 80s. In a sea of ultra-modern websites, this web <br>
      design layout stands out with its pixelated background, icons and blocky text. <br>
      1991 — The first web page <br>
      </h2>
      <h3>
      It’s not hard to see why Berners-Lee is thought of as the forefather <br>
      of web design–the man was busy! On August 6, 1991, he launched the world’s <br>
      first web page with the help of his team. Hosted on a NeXT computer at the <br>
      </h3>
      <h4>
      European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, this was a simple page <br>
      containing information about <br>
      </h4>
      <h5>
      the World Wide Web.
      This breakthrough forged a path for web designers, who mainly <br>
      </h5>
      <h6>
      worked with HTML tables to organize content horizontally and <br>
      vertically. These were text-only pages, devoid of any of the visual elements we associate <br>
      with modern web pages. 1992 — The first photo on the internet
      Long before celebrities ‘broke the internet’ or viral memes, a <br>
      seemingly mundane image started it all. In 1992, pop parody group <br>
      </h6>
      <u>
      Les Horribles Cernettes became the subjects of the very first photo <br>
      on the internet. When Berners-Lee rolled out an update of his browser <br>
      </u>
      that could support photos, his team tested it out of this image taken <br>
      of the band backstage by an IT developer.
