  <br>Seven months ago,<br> I &nbsp; sat down at the small table in the kitchen of my 1960s apartment,
    <br>nestled on the top floor of a building in a vibrant central neighbourhood of Tehran, and I did something I had done thousands of times previously. <br>
    I opened my laptop and posted to my new blog.   This, though, was the first time in six years. And it nearly broke my heart.<br>
    A few weeks earlier, I’d been abruptly pardoned and freed from Evin prison in northern Tehran. <br>
    I had been expecting to spend most of my life in those cells: In November 2008,
    <br>I’d been sentenced to nearly 20 years in jail, mostly for things I’d written on my blog.
    But the moment, when it came, was unexpected.<br>
     I smoked a cigarette in the kitchen with one of my fellow inmates, and came back to the room I shared with a dozen other men. <br>
     We were sharing a cup of tea when the voice of the floor announcer <br>
     —&nbsp;another&nbsp;prisoner&nbsp;— <br>
     filled all the rooms and corridors. In his flat voice,
     <br>he announced in Persian: <br>“Dear fellow inmates, <br>the bird of luck has once again sat on one fellow inmate’s shoulders.
     <br>Mr. Hossein Derakhshan, as of this moment, you are free.”
    That evening was the first time that I went out of those doors as a free man.
    <br>Everything felt new: The chill autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a nearby bridge, the smell,
    <br>the colors of the city I had lived in for most of my life.
    Around me,&nbsp;I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to. <br>
    An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with.
    <br><br>
    New roads, <br>
    new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs. <br>
    Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs.<br>
    Women in colorful scarves and manteaus,
    <br>men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. <br>
    They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people;
    <br>the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you.<br>
    Two weeks later, I began writing again. <br>
    Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine.<br>
    I called it Ketabkhan — it means book-reader in Persian.<br>
    Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it’s an entire era online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, <br>
    but reading — or, at least, getting things read —&nbsp;had&nbsp;altered&nbsp;dramatically.
    <br>I’d been told how essential social networks had become
    <br>while I’d been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing,
    <br> I had to use social media now.
    So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn’t care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad.
    <br>No description. No image. Nothing. It got three likes. Three! That was it.
    It became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. I was not equipped to play on this new turf
    <br>—&nbsp;all&nbsp;my investment and effort had burned up.&nbsp;I was devastated.
