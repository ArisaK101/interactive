  That evening was the first time that I went <br>  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

             out of those doors as a free man. Everything felt new: The chill autumn
  breeze, the traffic <br>  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

             noise from a nearby bridge, the smell, the colors of the city I had lived in for most of my
             <br>life. Around me, I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to. An influx of new,
             <br> shamelessly luxurious  condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with.
                      <br>
                                   New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs.
  Large billboards with advertisements <br>
  for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves
  and manteaus, <br>
  men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and
  <br> female staff.They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really <br>
  notice once normal life gets taken away from you.
  Two weeks later, I began writing again. <br> Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine.
  I called it Ketabkhan — <br> it means book-reader in Persian.
  Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it’s an entire era <br> online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed,
  but reading — or, at least, getting things read <br> — had altered dramatically. I’d been told how essential social networks
  had become while I’d been gone,<br>
   and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now.<br>
  So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn’t care much. <br>
  It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. No description. No image. Nothing. It got three likes. <br>
  Three! That was it.
  It became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. I was not equipped
  <br>to play on this new turf — all my investment
  and effort had burned up. I was devastated.
